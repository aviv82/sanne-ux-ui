## Strategy vs. Board

### What parts of your plan went as expected?

- Working with Aviv is great I learn a lot from him
- The planning part has been great, I think we dod as we were supposed to

### What parts of your plan did not work out?

- I had big problems with my first PR so I ended going back to start from the
  top... fingers crossed this time no problems.
- I get frustrated when everything in VS code is perfect and then you push and
  suddenly there is conflict on a project only I work on LOL
