# Retrospective

## Stop Doing

​

## Continue Doing

- Having a meeting every day makes the work flow process easier and less room
  for misunderstandings

​

## Start Doing

- ​

## Lessons Learned

- Great working with new people and having a sort of client interview which is
  useful for the future interviews we might be doing

## Strategy vs. Board

### What parts of your plan went as expected?

- Working with Aviv is great I learn a lot from him

### What parts of your plan did not work out?

- I had big problems with my first PR so I ended going back to start from the
  top... fingers crossed this time no problems.
- I get frustrated when everything in VS code is perfect and then you push and
  suddenly there is conflict on a project only I work on LOL

### Did you need to add things that weren't in your strategy?

-

### Or remove extra steps?
